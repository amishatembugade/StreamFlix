# StreamFlix
Tableau Project
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary/Engagement) analysis, segmenting a customer base into actionable groups (e.g., Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Hibernating, New Users).

Utilized customer behavioral data (visit frequency, watch time) to define key engagement metrics and drive comprehensive customer segmentation.

Designed a personalized messaging module within the dashboard, enabling targeted communication strategies for each identified customer segment to enhance engagement and retention.

Implemented key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Average Visit Frequency and Average Watch Time to provide a clear overview of customer engagement trends.

Incorporated dynamic filters (e.g., Gender, Segment) to allow for granular analysis and provide actionable insights for marketing and customer relationship management teams.

Translated complex customer data into intuitive visualizations, facilitating data-driven decision-making for personalized content recommendations and outreach efforts.
